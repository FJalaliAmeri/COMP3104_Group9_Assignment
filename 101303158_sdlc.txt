Effectively implementing DevOps methods would enable a process based on simplicity of deploying code to production servers, 
applying hot-fixes, catching mistakes before they result in some form of unexpected behavior,
and maintaining increased transparency & communication across all teams. 
A developer that approaches the software development lifecycle from the perspective of a DevOps Engineer 
will be more knowledgeable and skilled.
